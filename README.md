# Main-Flow_Taks_1
# Student Performance Data Analysis

This project analyzes student exam performance data using Python. It demonstrates essential data science skills including loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing real-world data.

 Dataset
- *File:* student-mat.csv
- *Source:* UCI Machine Learning Repository
- *Features include:* grades (G1, G2, G3), study time, gender, and other student-related attributes.

Objectives
- Load and explore the dataset using pandas
- Clean missing or duplicate data
- Answer key questions:
  - What is the average final grade (G3)?
  - How many students scored above 15?
  - Is there a correlation between study time and G3?
  - Which gender performs better on average?
- Visualize results using matplotlib and seaborn

Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights
- The average final grade and correlation with study time
- Distribution of scores
- Performance differences between male and female students

Files Included
- student-mat.csv: The dataset
- student_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with code and analysis
